Contains solution to the requirements. Could not unfortunately complete the
optional part.

By building the program with Maven, it will generate the JAR file "Crosskey_Codetest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" in the target folder.
By running this JAR file in the Windows terminal using the command:
*java -jar "path to JAR file"* (Note! Requires Java 1.8).
The program will be run.

Alternatively the program can be run inside of your IDE by simply executing the Main
method.
